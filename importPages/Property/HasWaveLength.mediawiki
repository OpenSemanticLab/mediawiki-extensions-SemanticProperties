|description=For a monochromatic wave, "wavelength" is the distance between two successive points in a direction perpendicular to the wavefront where at a given instant the phase differs by ''2 Pi'' . The wavelength of a sinusoidal wave is the spatial period of the waveâ€”the distance over which the wave's shape repeats. The SI unit of wavelength is the meter.
